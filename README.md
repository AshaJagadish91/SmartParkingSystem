# SmartParkingSystem
A Hackathon End-to-End project

Abstract
Smart parking system uses sensors to create a real-time feed of the parking occupancies. This data is aggregated and fed to an ML engine for training on demand forecasting. We also developed a Mobile App that allows the admin to set dynamic pricing based on the forecasted demand. The App also allows end users to view the pricing models and make parking reservation in real time.

Technologies Used :
 IR sensors (FC-51) and Arduino uno R3 boards
 ML framework – Tensorflow / Keras
 Mobile App Framework–Android Studio
 Data Collection:
 		Real world Data
    	CityOfSeattle – (2014-2018) (15000 entries)
    	Synthetic Data of 50000 parking occupancies
  	Central Business District – 25,000 entries
  	Mall Dataset – 25,000 entries
	Preprocessing methods :
  	Data Cleaning
  	Format Recognition
  	Database Creation
	ML architecture: Three layer neural network    architecture.
